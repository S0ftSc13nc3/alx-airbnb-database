# Database Seed Script

This folder contains the `seed.sql` script, which populates the Airbnb database with sample data for testing.

## Data Included

- **3 Users**
- **2 Owners**
- **3 Properties** linked to owners
- **Multiple amenities** linked to properties
- **3 Bookings** by different users

## Usage

2. Run the commands in `seed.sql` to insert test data into your tables.
3. You can now use SELECT queries to explore the data.
